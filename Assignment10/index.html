    <h2>Question 1:</h2>
    <br>

Write the necessary Node script to make this code work for all arrays: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].even(); // [2,4,6,8] [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].odd(); // [1,3,5,7] Test your code in Node.JS CLI

 

<h2>Question 2: </h2>
<br>

    1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
    <br>
    <div>
        <h3>Answer 1:</h3>
        setImmediate() is to schedule the immediate execution of callback after I/O events callbacks and before setTimeout and setInterval . setTimeout() is to schedule execution of a one-time callback after delay milliseconds.
    </div>
    <br>
    2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
    <div>
        <h3>Answer 2:</h3>
        nextTick() is processed after every phase of the event loop and setImmediate() is only processed on the check handler phase of the event loop.

    <br>
    3. Does Node.js has window object?
    <div>
        <h3>Answer 3:</h3>
        In the Node. js module system, each file is treated as a separate module. The Global objects are available in all modules. While in browsers, the global scope is the window object, in nodeJS, the global scope of a module is the module itself, so when you define a variable in the global scope of your Node.
