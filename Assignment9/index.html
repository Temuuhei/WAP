        <h2>Question 1:</h2>
        Use class syntax to create LinkedList. Methods below:
        <br>
        1) add(value)
        <br>
        2) remove(value)
        <br>
        3) print()
        <br>
        You’re allowed to add other methods if it’s necessary.
        After completion, we can call methods as below and see the results in console if call print().
        <br>
        linkedlist.add(1);
        <br>
        linkedlist.add(2);
        <br>
        linkedlist.add(3);
        <br>
        linkedlist.print(); //in the console, you should see: LinkedList{1,2,3}
        <br>
        linkedlist.remove(3);
        <br>
        linkedlist.print(); //in the console, you should see: LinkedList{1,3}

        <h2>Question 2:</h2>
        This is a quiz system which allows students to take quiz, get each student's quiz score and
        compute average score of students.
        You need to use constructor functions or class syntax to implement Student, Question and Quiz
        constructor function/class Student:
        properties:
        studentId: a unique student id
        answers: holds an array that records the student's answers for the questions.
        method: addAnswer(question) - add student's question(id, answer) to answers array.
        constructor function/class
        <br>
        Question:
        <br>
        properties:
        <br>
        qid: unique quesiton id
        <br>
        answer: hold quiz correct answer or student's answermethod: checkAnswer(answer) - used to check if student's
        answer is correct
        constructor function/class Quiz:
        properties:
        <br>
        questions: It's a Map which holds question id and correct answers. The key is question id, the
        value is the correct answer for this question
        <br>
        students: an array holds all students
        methods:
        <br>
        scoreStudent(sid), computes the quiz score for this student
        getAverageScore(), computes the average score over all students
        After you complete the Question, Student and Quiz constructor functions, we may use the
        system as below:
        Your system should return the correct result for getAverageScore() and scoreStudent(sid) as the
        expected result.
        <br>
        const student1 = new Student(10);
        <br>
        student1.addAnswer(new Question(2, 'a'));
        <br>
        student1.addAnswer(new Question(3, 'b'));
        <br>
        student1.addAnswer(new Question(1, 'b'));
        <br>
        const student2 = new Student(11);
        <br>
        student2.addAnswer(new Question(3, 'b'));
        <br>
        student2.addAnswer(new Question(2, 'a'));
        <br>
        student2.addAnswer(new Question(1, 'd'));
        <br>
        const students = [student1, student2];
        <br>
        const questions =[new Question(1, 'b'), new Question(2, 'a'), new
        <br>
        Question(3, 'b')];
        <br>
        const quiz = new Quiz(questions, students);
        <br>
        let scoreforStudent10 = quiz.scoreStudentBySid(10);
        <br>
        console.log(scoreforStudent10); //Expected Result: 3
        <br>
        let scoreforStudent11 = quiz.scoreStudentBySid(11);
        <br>
        console.log(scoreforStudent11); //Expected Result: 2
        <br>
        let average = quiz.getAverageScore();
